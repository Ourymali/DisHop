Discipline Hopping project diary and Work in Progress <br>
This repository is an attempt to keep track of my progress and errances as a newcomer to coding and this whole computer world on the other side of the looking glass (is it?). The Adventures of Malice in Coderland, say, but only in the French sense of "malice", which means "mischief", "cheekiness".<br>
I'm a Lecturer in French Studies in the UK, specialized in 20th- and 21st-century literature, including (and now especially) (expreimental) electronic literature, and here I am in France learning some basic coding and co., crossing languages, cultures, and disciplines.<br>
It's all very exciting and I have no idea what will come out of it, but I'm here to explore (also) how this learning opens my eyes to new modes of thinking and doing things. Welcome on board and enjoy the ride, if you do step over this line (and don't worry, you can get out at any point!)
